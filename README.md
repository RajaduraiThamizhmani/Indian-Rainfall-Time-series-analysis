# Indian-Rainfall-Time-series-analysis
Statistical evaluation of rainfall time series Trend analysis of long-term Indian rainfall records over the period 1901–2010 utilizing 12 hydrological stations located at the Ken River basin (KRB) in Madhya Pradesh, India. 


1. There are 5 tests performed in the above paper (Auto-correlation, Homogeneity tests, Linear regression tests, Mann–Kendall (MK) test, Sen’s slope estimator test). Repeat any 3 out of 5 tests for the district of Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh. (You don’t have to generate maps or present any geospatial output, just the time series testing is sufficient.)

2. How does the results compare to the 12 districts analysed in the paper? (Just comment is sufficient, you don’t have to extract KRB data for comparison plots. )

3. There is monthly data available for all the years. Can you extract the annual variability w.r.t monsoon season over the last ten years?  What are your observations? Plot time series graphs to elaborate. 

4. Recommend other directions that orienting this work? For that, what other datasets would you like to explore to validate the results and extend this project.
